There have been 2 issues that came up this week. One is very familiar and the other seems to surface every now and again. Both are cutting into profits. 

## Fear of loss
This one is the lesser of the 2 evils and I have managed to catch the emotions before I close trades more often than not, but this week the problem was very obvious and led to a fair dent in profits. The best example is this [trade](https://delicate-banoffee-98b628.netlify.app/post/2023.11.11-17_10-neo-nasd-%EF%B8%8F/) 

You can see here that I had no good reason to close this trade. My SL was close to BE and I had little to lose leaving the trade running. Instead I closed it based on a fear of loss. 
## Greed
This one, and I am not sure it is always greed, but it is the big one. I place a trade with little thought or consideration for the outcome. I see a movement, think it is going the right way and take an impulsive short at it. It can happen as the first trade of the day and it can happen as a result of a trade where the result is not a win. This can be break even (BE) or a loss. [Here](https://delicate-banoffee-98b628.netlify.app/post/2023.11.08-10_50-lo-dow-/) is a good example of a reaction after not winning and jumping back in again.
