### Session
FO
### Trade
Trading DAX, Long with SDF
## Pre-trade
FO so decided to trade 1/2 risk. The PA was good and a clear up move from Frankfurt open. Emotions - apprehensive
## Entry
I waited for the TLB to complete as it was a ghost candle on the TLB. This meant a late entry and it gapped up as I entered
## Exit
Set TC just before M15 TZ2. Closing at TZ2 would have given me 5, but there was a chance of it pushing higher as LO was 1 min
## Post Trade and Comments
All in all very happy with the trade and management. I held the SL through the dips until a clear break higher, gave it plenty of room. Wished I had traded full risk (0.5%), but hindsight is a great thing. Nice PA helped here a lot.
