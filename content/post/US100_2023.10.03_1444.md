### Target, Setup and Entry
An interesting trade with price pushing through the ONL. I am revising my rules for SDF trades where there needs to be either a good rejection or 2 or more upside rejections to the demand or support that have been smashed. Is this a AAA+ trade? No. Is it a dumb arse trade? No. It could have gone either way, but decided to spike up taking me out. I did have the way with all to set BE, so no loss.
