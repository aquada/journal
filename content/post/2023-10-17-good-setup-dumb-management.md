### Target, Setup and Entry
Decent setup, pre NEO, BE too early, would have been a good winner
### Trade Management
none
### Exit
BE
### Mindset pre and post trade
This was just dumb. After taking the trade I found myself doubting the setup as the NEO session had not opened and wanted to avoid a loss. The setup was valid and I would have done well to have faith.
