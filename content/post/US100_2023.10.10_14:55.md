### Setup
A good trade at NEO with an Accelerated Correction down to the overnight high. The setup looked good with a rejection near ONH, although admittedly not touching. Target was TZ1 on M15, which it did reach. Closed early as it was late in the session. 
### Mindset
The only trade of the day. Everything felt good about the trade and I was thinking clearly.
