### Session
NEO
### Trade
Trading NASD, Short with ABC-FE
## Pre-trade
Confusion about PA, loosing confidence
## Entry
I waited for the next retrace and held SL at FE100, Entered on rejection candle
## Exit
With PA I was worried it was a mistake to enter so set BE early. It did not get triggered, and bounce at demand spooked me, closed early
## Post Trade and Comments
I'm looking at the PA now and it is still falling and it's uncertain. If I am honest I should have left the trade. Emotions were a little off, tired and a little edgy, and PA certainly was not the best.
